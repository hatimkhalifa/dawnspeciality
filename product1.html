                 <strong>Quote: </strong>   <p>As leaders in the education community, it is our goal, if not our obligation, to ensure that when 
students leave their secondary education, they are equipped with the skills they need to lead a successful and fulfilling adult 
life. Too often though that is not the case, and students graduate high school without the tools to ensure they succeed in whatever
 path they choose to follow.</p>

                    <strong>From the students:Jessica N.</strong>
                    <p> When I started this course I did not know what to expect. I didn't imagine how it would change my perception
 and behavior towards high school life as well as in my personal life. It made me change my attitude with my school tasks, how to 
have more discipline and commitment. Also my ability to listen and observe has been improved everyday.</p>
